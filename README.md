### Main Module  
1. **Odroid XU4** The Odroid XU4 is a small-scale board that comprises of a Samsung Exynos. An Exynos is designed for power efficiency. The Exynos cpu is targeted for edge computing which is processing information at a quicker rate and volume leading up to quicker re)sults. The manufacturer of the Odroid is Hardkernel Co., Ltd, located in South Korea. [Odroid XU4](https://https://wiki.odroid.com/odroid-xu4/odroid-xu4)
2. **Radiation Sensor** The Radiation Sensor detects Beta (radioactive decaay) and Gamma (electromagnetic radiation) Radiation. There are three types of radiation sensors, gas ionization, scintillation, and semiconductor. Hans Geiger and Walther Muller is most known for the invention and improvement of the radiation sensor. [Radiation Sensor](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/radiation-detector#:~:text=There%20are%20three%20different%20main,%2C%20and%20Geiger%E2%80%93M%C3%BCller%20counter)
3. **Arduino Nano** The Arduino Nano by the Arduino company develops micro-controllers that are eventually used to communicate witth other sensors. The Arduino Nano uses RS-232 to serial communicate transmission of data (information.) Arduino Nano was invented after Massimo Banzi David Caurtielles established the company Arduino itself.

### Air Module 
The Air Module consists of climate and and solar radiation sensors that protect the outer layer from climate factors while still leaving room for air.
1. **Alphasense OCP-N3** can detect and measure pollen and consists of a temperature and humidity sensor. An OPC detects the measure of dust particles as it is exposed in the light. The Alphanese OCP-N3 was launcheed by the Alphanese company.[OCP-N388](https://www.alphasense.com/products/optical-particle-counter/)
2. **HM3301** HM3301 is a laser sensor that catches a real-time detection of dust particles in the air. [HM3301](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Laser_PM2.5_Sensor-HM3301/) 
3. **SCD30** The SCD30 sensor is an inexpensive gas sensor that produces an estimate of Carbon dioxide. [SCD-30](https://mintswiki.trecis.cloud/mediawiki/index.php/Central_Node)
4. **MiCS-6814** The MiCS-6814 produces an estimate of gaseous chemicals such as Carbon monoxide, Nitrogen dioxide, Ethanol, Hydrogen, Azane, Methane, Propane, and Butane. [MiCS-6814](https://mintswiki.trecis.cloud/mediawiki/index.php/Central_Node)
5. **BME280** The BME280 sensor measures temperature, pressure, and humidity. BME280 is also used to help with PM measurements.

### Sound and Lightning Module
The Sound and Lightning Module includes sensors that are usually smile in size and tend to not be affected tp rain or fog/condensation.
1. **SEN0232** The SEN0232 sensor measures the validity of sound. Ultimately, the sensor is supposed to identify whether the sound is detremental to our health. [SEN0232](https://wiki.dfrobot.com/Gravity__Analog_Sound_Level_Meter_SKU_SEN0232)
2. **DPLM20GP** The DPLM20GP sensor measure audio events.
3. **SEN0290** The SEN0290 sensor measures lightning distance, intensity, and frequency. [SEN0290](https://wiki.dfrobot.com/Gravity:%20Lightning%20Sensor%20SKU:%20SEN0290)

### LoRa Module
The LoRa Module consists of the Solar, Main, Battery and Air Modules.
1. **Jetson Nano** The Jetson Nano measures temperature, humidity, and air pressure. The Jetson Nano can also be used to build a robot that'll detect motion and orientation (position or direction.)
2. **Raspberry Pi** The Raspberry Pi sensor measures relative humididty and teemperatures between -55 and 125 degress celsius. This sensor is used for transmitting signals from external reactions. 
3. **LoRa Gateway** The LoRa Gateway is the primary link/chain for communication and data transmission. The creator of the LoRa Gateway sensor is the Cycleo company.
4. **Storage Drive** The Storage Drive is responsible for discovering the storage attached to a computer system. The drive extracts, stores and transfers important files and data.
5. **Ethernet Switch** The Ethernet Switch is meant to connect several devices and servers to the local nerwork.
