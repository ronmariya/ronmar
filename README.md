### Main Module  
1. **Odroid XU4** The Odroid XU4 is a small-scale board that comprises of a Samsung Exynos. An Exynos is designed for power efficiency. The Exynos cpu is targeted for edge computing which is processing information at a quicker rate and volume leading up to quicker re)sults. The manufacturer of the Odroid is Hardkernel Co., Ltd, located in South Korea. [**Odroid XU4**](https://https://wiki.odroid.com/odroid-xu4/odroid-xu4)
2. **Radiation Sensor** The Radiation Sensor detects Beta (radioactive decaay) and Gamma (electromagnetic radiation) Radiation. There are three types of radiation sensors, gas ionization, scintillation, and semiconducotr. Hans Geiger and Walther Muller is most known for the invention and improvement of the radiation sensor. [**Radiation Sensor**](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/radiation-detector#:~:text=There%20are%20three%20different%20main,%2C%20and%20Geiger%E2%80%93M%C3%BCller%20counter)
3. **Arduino Nano** The Arduino Nano by the Arduino company develops micro-controllers that are eventually used to communicate witth other sensors. The Arduino Nano uses RS-232 to serial communicate transmission of data (information.) Arduino Nano was invented after Massimo Banzi David Caurtielles established the company Arduino itself.

### Air Module The Air Module consists of climate and and solar radiation sensors that protect the outer layer from climate factors while still leaving room for air.
1. **Alphasens OCP-N3** can detect and measure pollen and consists of a temperature and humidity sensor. An OPC detects the measure of dust particles as it is exposed in the light. The Alphanese OCP-N3 was launcheed by the Alphanese company.[OCP-N3](https://www.alphasense.com/products/optical-particle-counter/)
