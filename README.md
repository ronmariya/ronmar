### Main Module  
1. **Odroid XU4** The Odroid XU4 is a small-scale board that comprises of a Samsung Exynos. An Exynos is designed for power efficiency. The Exynos cpu is targeted for edge computing which is processing information at a quicker rate and volume leading up to quicker results. 
2. **Radiation Sensor** The Radiation Sensor detects Beta (radioactive decaay) and Gamma (electromagnetic radiation) Radiation. 
3. **Arduino Nano** The Arduino Nano by the Arduino company develops micro-controllers that are eventually used to communicate witth the Odroid XU4.
